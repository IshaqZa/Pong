### Game: Pong
This is a simple version of Pong made as an assignemt for Computer Graphics course.

Uses OpenGL and other libraries(some of which are):
- GLM(OpenGL Matrices) -> for transformation calculations on object vertices.

Current unresolved bugs:
- Hit boxes for graphics go out of sync when Circle::reset() command gets called(basically visuals are rendered incorrectly someone scores)
